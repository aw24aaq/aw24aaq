## Solo Projects
Running Tracker / Calculator - (15/12/2025 - 03/01/2026)
- During the Christmas break, I set myself a small personal project to further develop the skills I learned in the practical sessions and apply them to an area I am passionate about.

## Team Projects
Enigma Chess Engine - (01/01/2025 - 26/03/2025)
- Over the three and a half months that the project was active, I contributed to the development of the project’s timer and helped create the design concepts. The initial designs were produced using Figma.

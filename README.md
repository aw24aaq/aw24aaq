## Solo Projects
Running Tracker / Calculator - (15/12/2025 - 03/01/2026)
- During the Christmas break, I set myself a small personal project to further develop the skills I learned in the practical sessions and apply them to an area I am passionate about.


This is the display window for the program:

This is the saved text file version of the program:

### Next Steps
- Currently working on converting the application to Java and enabling it to run on a mobile platform.

## Team Projects
Enigma Chess Engine - (01/01/2025 - 26/03/2025)
- Over the three and a half months that the project was active, I contributed to the development of the project’s timer and helped create the design concepts. The initial designs were produced using Figma. [Figma interactive Prototype:](https://www.figma.com/proto/mSfgbX5TX1UXX5q94VlIkY/En-Passant?node-id=53-171&starting-point-node-id=53%3A171&t=csjMVub17oEsUshQ-1)

This is one of the figma designs for the time:

This the the timer count down from 5 min in the program:
